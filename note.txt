* Reading from .npy file is a numpy array of float32s
* Original client file requires int8 numpy array --> Does not fit to the above condition
* Random int8 numpy array is generated when the input file is not provided --> Anakha tested with this one (guess)
* So changed the line 80 in pvaClient.py --> from 'shortValue' to 'floatValue'

* 1st test with 128x128x100Hz, ptychoNN_8_128.onnx (batch size is 8, I don't know what this means....)
